# QuickMyAnimeList
QuickMyAnimeList is a work-in-progress handy Chrome extension that allows you to edit, add, or delete an anime in your MyAnimeList list. 

## Webstore
I will not put this Chrome Extension on the webstore, simply because I don't bother.

## Installation
Download all the files as a ZIP, and then follow an instruction somewhere online on how to install unpacked extensions.

## Development
The Chrome Extension uses jQuery for mostly everything, including the AJAX Requests, the Show/Hide toggles, the Next/Previous buttons, and a lot more. Without jQuery, this Chrome Extension would be nothing.

The MAL API also hepled out a TON in creating this. Well, not helped out, but more like, was neccessary. Becuase without the API, the extension wouldn't have been able to retreive, add, and delete data from your anime list.
