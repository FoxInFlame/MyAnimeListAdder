# QuickMyAnimeList
QuickMyAnimeList is a work-in-progress handy Chrome extension that allows you to edit, add, or delete an anime in your MyAnimeList list. 

## Webstore
I will not put this Chrome Extension on the webstore, simply because I don't bother.

## Installation
Download all the files as a ZIP, and then follow an instruction somewhere online on how to install unpacked extensions.

## Development
The Chrome Extension uses jQuery for mostly everything, including the AJAX Requests, the Show/Hide toggles, the Next/Previous buttons, and a lot more. Without jQuery, this Chrome Extension would be nothing.

The MAL API also hepled out a TON in creating this. Well, not helped out, but more like, was neccessary. Becuase without the API, the extension wouldn't have been able to retreive, add, and delete data from your anime list.

Not just the MAL API, but a whole freaking JS/CSS library helped me style it to look like Google's Material Design. The library is called Material Design Bootstrap, and as the name suggests, I used Twitter Boostrap as well.

I use a lot of inline styling. I know it's a bad practice, but I really don't like to go back and forth between files just to edit one simple margin. So please bear with me.
